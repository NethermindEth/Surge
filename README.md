  Surge Rollup
</h1>

Surge is a high-performance, based rollup template built on a modified Taiko Alethia stack, aligning with Ethereum's principles of decentralization and security and featuring Gigagas performance, decentralized ordering by Ethereum validators, and Stage 2 trustless security.

## What is this repo?

This repository contains chain specifications for different Surge testnets. These files define the network parameters and initial states required to set up and operate Surge testnets. If you want to run an execution client with a modified chainspec, you can take these files and customize them as needed.


The core codebase for Surge resides in the [Surge Taiko Mono](https://github.com/NethermindEth/surge-taiko-mono) repository, while other repositories provide supporting tools, libraries, and documentation to facilitate development and deployment.
